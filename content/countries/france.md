## Getting There and Around

France has several major international airports, including Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), Paris Orly (ORY), and Nice Côte d'Azur (NCE). The best time to find cheaper flights is typically during the shoulder and off-seasons. Within France, the high-speed train network (TGV) is an efficient way to travel between major cities. Renting a car is a good option for exploring the countryside, but be aware of tolls and parking fees. Public transportation is readily available in most cities.

If you're looking for alternatives to France, consider nearby destinations like Italy, Spain, Switzerland, or Belgium, all offering unique cultural experiences and attractions.
