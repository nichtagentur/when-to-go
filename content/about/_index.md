## About When To Go

When To Go is a travel resource dedicated to one simple question: **When is the best time to visit?**

We cover all 195 countries with in-depth, month-by-month travel guides that help you plan the perfect trip. Every article includes weather data, activity recommendations, budget tips, and insider knowledge from experienced travelers.

## Our Mission

Travel planning starts with timing. Visit Thailand during monsoon season and you'll have a very different experience than during the cool, dry months. Arrive in Iceland in winter and you'll see the Northern Lights -- but miss the midnight sun.

We believe every traveler deserves access to clear, reliable timing information to make the most of their trips.

## Our Editorial Process

Every guide on When To Go follows a rigorous process:

1. **Research** -- We compile climate data, festival calendars, and tourism statistics from official sources
2. **Expert Review** -- Our senior travel editor, Elena Vasquez, reviews every article based on her 15+ years of travel experience
3. **Regular Updates** -- Guides are updated annually to reflect changing conditions and new information

## Tour Recommendations

Some of our guides include links to multi-day tours on TourRadar. These are clearly marked as sponsored links. We only recommend tour options for destinations where guided tours genuinely add value to the travel experience.
