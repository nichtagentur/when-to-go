## Best Time for Popular Activities

**Cherry Blossom Viewing (Hanami):** Without a doubt, late March to early April is the prime time for experiencing the iconic cherry blossoms. Keep in mind, the exact timing varies depending on the region, with warmer areas blooming earlier than cooler ones. Track the "sakura zensen" (cherry blossom front) forecasts for the most accurate predictions.

**Autumn Foliage Viewing (Koyo):** Mid-October to late November offers breathtaking displays of autumn colors. Like cherry blossoms, the foliage season progresses from north to south, starting in Hokkaido and gradually moving down the islands. Kyoto and other historical cities are particularly stunning during this time.

**Hiking:** May and October provide ideal weather conditions for hiking in Japan's mountainous regions. The temperatures are mild, the skies are clear, and the scenery is spectacular. The Japanese Alps offer numerous trails for all skill levels.

**Skiing and Snowboarding:** January and February are the peak months for skiing and snowboarding, especially in Hokkaido and the Japanese Alps. Expect deep powder snow and excellent conditions.

**Festivals (Matsuri):** Japan hosts countless festivals throughout the year. Summer festivals (July-August) are particularly vibrant, with traditional dances, parades, and fireworks. However, be prepared for hot and humid weather. For example, the Gion Matsuri in Kyoto (July) is world-famous.
