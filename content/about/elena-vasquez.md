Elena has spent the last 15 years traveling to over 80 countries across six continents. Her expertise lies in helping travelers find the perfect window to visit their dream destinations -- balancing weather, crowds, costs, and seasonal experiences.

### Background

Elena began her career writing destination guides for travel publishers in 2010. Over the years, she developed a deep understanding of global climate patterns, regional tourism cycles, and the subtle differences that make each month unique in every corner of the world.

### Expertise

- **Seasonal travel planning** -- knowing when crowds thin and prices drop
- **Activity-based timing** -- from safari seasons to cherry blossom peaks
- **Budget optimization** -- finding the sweet spot between good weather and lower prices

"There's no such thing as a bad time to travel -- only a time that doesn't match what you're looking for. My goal is to help you find your perfect match."

### Countries Visited

Elena has extensive first-hand experience in Southeast Asia, South America, East Africa, Southern Europe, and the Middle East. She visits 8-10 new destinations each year to keep her knowledge current.
